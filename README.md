# spider_solitaire
C++ project: spider_solitaire

This is one-suit spider solitaire for C++. This is a program I wrote, just for fun, to practice certain C++ and good coding practice skills. The program uses design patterns: model/view/controller and the Command pattern. The command pattern was used to acheive the undo/redo feature. Also, you can click and drag to make moves or simply click a card and the program will execute the first possible legal move. Of course you can always undo as many moves as you want. The goal of the game is to get all cards into the 'Ace' piles at the top right of the screen by creating complete 'stacks', from Ace to King.

'Hotkeys':

'D' = re-Deal

'Z' = undo

'Y' = redo

'M' = play winning "cardburst" animation (hit any key to stop)
